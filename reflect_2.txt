ok, so after using <<git init>> to create a git repository,
we need to use <<git add>> to add files to track by that git repo.

before doing a commit, one can 'add' or remove files from the staging area.
This is more flexible and give control over what to commit or not.

branches:
useful for doing experimental new features, or major modifications to work on in parrallel to the master branch. eg: language versioning.
